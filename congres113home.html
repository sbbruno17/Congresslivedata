                    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                    <p>
                        Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                        transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
                        of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government
                        should be transparent.<br>

                        Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
                        and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
                        allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information
                        for citizens about what their Government is doing.<br>

                        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                        Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely
                        dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
                        knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.<br>

                        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                        public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                        <h3>Backgroun History of Government Transparency</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to
                            public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes
                            made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual
                            project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to
                            this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                            territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press
                            Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to
                            recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.<br>

                            Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                            freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting
                            and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by
                            Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of
                            eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
                            latter.<br>

                            Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and
                            is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries
                            claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of
                            its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
                            openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                            Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).<br>

                            The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                            Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
